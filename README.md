# implementation-of-logic-gates


#AIM:

To implement or gate using nand gate only.

#EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:

#Hardwares:PCs,Cyclone II,USB flasher
#Software:Quarts Prime
#Theory:
To implement NAND operation using OR gate, we first complement the inputs and then perform OR on the complemented inputs.we get A'+B'.A'+B' is equivalent to(AB)' which can be shown to be true by using de morgans law.

#PROGRAM:
 
Developed by:N.Swetha

Register no:22008828

#PROCEDURE:

Place the IC on IC Trainer Kit.

2. Connect VCC and ground to respective pins of IC Trainer Kit.

3. Implement the circuit as shown in the circuit diagram.

4. Connect

the inputs to

the input

switches provided in the IC Trainer Kit. 5. Connect the outputs to the switches of O/P LEDS

6. Apply various combinations of inputs according to the truth table and observe the condition of LEDs.

7. Note down the corresponding output readings for various combinations of inputs.

8. Power Off Trainer Kit, disconnect all the wire connections and remove IC's from IC-Base.
